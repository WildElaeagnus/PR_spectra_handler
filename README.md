<div>Photoreflection spectra handler </div>
This program is designed for the processing of 
photoreflection spectra, specifically for fitting 
the shape of the interference signal into the 
spectrum.
Filtering out the interference signal in the 
spectrum can help to detect a more complex signal 
that has been distorted by the 
interference overlay.
